#About


Paper resumes suck. They are inconvenient to carry around. They are boring to read. There are always multiple versions. 

I decided to turn my resume into a website to address these concerns. This makes the site easy to access, and it allows linking to various projects. The site is based on the [Spacelab Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), so design is responsive. Storing the site as a public git repository allows version control and a degree of accountability as changes are made.  

# DEPRECATION

I no longer maintain this repo because I incorporated the resume into my personal website at [philipithomas.com/resume/](https://www.philipithomas.com/resume/). The new version uses Jekyll - check out its source [here](https://www.github.com/philipithomas/www.philipithomas.com). If you want to see a live example of this repository, check out [php-cv.herouapp.com](http://php-cv.herokuapp.com).
